# NewYorkTaxiPrice_Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting taxi fares in New York City using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop models that accurately estimate the fare amount for taxi rides based on various input features such as pickup and dropoff locations, number of passengers, and distance traveled.

## Overview
The project is structured as follows:

Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the data for model training, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and filtering out outliers.
Model Building:
Linear Regression: Implementation of a simple linear regression model as a baseline.
Regularized Regression (Lasso and Ridge): Utilization of Lasso and Ridge regression to improve model performance and mitigate overfitting.
Neural Network (Feedforward): Development of a basic feedforward neural network using Keras to capture nonlinear relationships in the data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation of each model's performance using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).
Submission: Generating predictions using the best-performing model and submitting the results.
Requirements
Python 3
Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, etc.)
